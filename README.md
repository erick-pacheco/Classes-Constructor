# Class
Java Classes/Objects
Java is an object-oriented programming language.

Everything in Java is associated with classes and objects, along with its attributes and methods. For example: in real life, a car is an object. The car has attributes, such as weight and color, and methods, such as drive and brake.

A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.

### Constructor
A constructor is a block of code that will be run when a class is instantiated. Instantiation is the process of Java creating an instance of an object in memory according to the class type. To start the process of instantiation, we use the new keyword. A constructor is executed once per object that gets created.

## object
An instance of a particular class; also the core concept of the OOP
